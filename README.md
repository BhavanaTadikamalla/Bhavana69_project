A basic text editor like sublime text for writing programs and a server for databases like Xampp Control Panel.

A webpage will be opened ,click on download button and follow the steps for installations.
Similarly the same process for xampp control panel.

Databases
Click on the button Admin under MySql then a page gets opened under click on new buttion and create your own databse and under that click new to create tables with specific columns and click Go, tables will be created.

Running the tests
1.Once all the installations are over download my folder and place that folder in C drive.
2.In order to have the basic look of the website ,open xampp control panel and clicl the start button for both Apache and SQL.
3.Now click on admin button in Apache module.On clicking this it will redirect to the browser and it will display the files present in your system.
4.Click on the folder you have downloaded and select homepage.php under php folder the you can see the whole website look.
5.If you individually want to test any fine type the corresponding path of the file and execute.
Ex: If I want to execute my login page you can select that particular file i.e localhost/Bhavana69_project/php/login.php
