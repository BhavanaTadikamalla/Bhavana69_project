Project Title
Freshoo!!

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

Prerequisites
A basic text editor like sublime text for writing programs and a server for databases like Xampp Control Panel.

Installing
Open any browser , and type the text editor name you wish to install. I have used Sublime text 3.
A webpage will be opened ,click on download button and follow the steps for installations.
Similarly the same process for xampp control panel.
Steps:
Open the XAMPP website. Go to https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html in your computer's web browser
Click XAMPP for Windows. It's a grey button near the bottom of the page.
Depending on your browser, you may first have to select a save location or verify the download. 
Double-click the downloaded file. This file should be named something like xampp-win32-7.2.4-0-VC15-installer, and you'll find it in the default downloads location (e.g., the "Downloads" folder or the desktop).
Click Yes when prompted. This will open the XAMPP setup window.
You may have to click OK on a warning if you have User Account Control (UAC) activated on your computer. 
Click Next. It's at the bottom of the setup window. 
Click Finish when prompted. It's at the bottom of the XAMPP window. Doing so will close the window and open the XAMPP Control Panel, which is where you'll access your servers.

Databases
Click on the button Admin under MySql then a page gets opened under click on new buttion and create your own databse and under that click new to create tables with specific columns and click Go, tables will be created.

Running the tests
1.Once all the installations are over download my folder and place that folder in C drive.
2.In order to have the basic look of the website ,open xampp control panel and clicl the start button for both Apache and SQL.
3.Now click on admin button in Apache module.On clicking this it will redirect to the browser and it will display the files present in your system.
4.Click on the folder you have downloaded and select homepage.php under php folder the you can see the whole website look.
5.If you individually want to test any fine type the corresponding path of the file and execute.
Ex: If I want to execute my login page you can select that particular file i.e localhost/Bhavana69_project/php/login.php
6.This is how you can execute your files
